## Description

This is the final project for CSCI E-15. We were given the task to build a web app using the Laravel framework which include everything we've learned from the course. What I decided to build was an app to record the beers you drink and the breweries you visit. As beer-lover with an interest in breweries and the brewing process, I wanted to make something that I would actually find useful. I've tried using a beer diary, but found that I never had it with me when I wanted to write down what I thought of the beer. In this app, you register with your name and email, and then you can start building your own personal list of beers and breweries. For a beer, you can record the name, the brewery, a description, a star rating, as well as add a url for an image of the beer. Similarly for breweries, you can add the name, location, a description, a star rating, as well as a url for an image of the brewery.
